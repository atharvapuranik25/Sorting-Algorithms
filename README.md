# Sorting-Algorithms

Problem Statement:
Sorting is ordering a list of objects. Using comparisons to sort items is useful for nearly every algorithmic problem.  In this exercise, you will implement and compare sorting algorithms and measure their efficiency in terms of swaps and comparisons. Finally, you will be commenting on the complexity tradeoff for all the algorithms.
